      <h1>How Consultancies Use LinkedIn to Signal Strategy</h1>
      <p class="subhead">McKinsey, BCG, and EY are all-in on AI—but what’s left behind?</p>
    </div>

    <p>As trusted advisors to the world’s most powerful corporations, consultancies try to stay ahead of the curve. One under-examined window into their evolving priorities is their public messaging—particularly on LinkedIn.</p>

    <p>Having worked at McKinsey, I witnessed firsthand how quickly a firm’s strategic emphasis can shift. My own entry into consulting was driven by the promise of shaping ambitious climate strategies. But that idealism ran headlong into a new reality: AI fever and cost-cutting overtook climate as boardroom obsessions.</p>

    <p>In 2024, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/21/mckinsey-emissions-climate">Guardian</a> reported that McKinsey knew as early as 2021 that its clients were driving rising global emissions. Yet senior leadership hesitated to act—sustainability became expendable in a tougher market.</p>

    <p>Are the firm’s public signals aligned with these internal shifts? To explore this, I analyzed the LinkedIn output of McKinsey, BCG, and EY from May to early August 2025. Each post was tagged by theme—from AI and geopolitics to ESG and HR.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>AI dominates. All three firms tout their tech credentials through reports, case studies, and employee profiles. With software companies expanding into implementation services, consultancies appear eager to guard their turf.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>McKinsey posts the most—and leans hardest into AI. That may be a response to media projections that BCG could surpass it within two years due to stronger tech offerings. The firm’s climate and ESG messaging, once central, has thinned noticeably.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>BCG, too, emphasizes AI but strikes more balance—maintaining focus on strategy and corporate transformation. Its content suggests an attempt to remain both innovative and grounded.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>EY takes a steadier approach. While tech is visible, its dominant themes remain business fundamentals. This positioning may signal durability over trend-chasing—leaving more space for long-term goals, including ESG.</p>

    <p>In a crowded market, consultancies are not just selling services—they’re signaling relevance. LinkedIn has become their stage. What they choose to emphasize speaks volumes about what they believe clients—and recruits—want to hear.</p>
